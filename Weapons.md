### One-dimensional:

#### K/D 
Kill Death ratio, generally implying how powerful a weapon is.

It is obvious that the weapons could be divided into four tiers:
- Tier 0:
Groza, M249, AUG (all these three come from crates only)
- Tier 1:
M416, QBZ, AKM, MK14, DP-28, Tmmmy Gun, SCAR-L, UMP9, AWM
- Tier 2:
Vector, Micro UZI, M16A4, S12K, SLR, S1897, VSS, SKS, S686, Mini14, M24, QBU, Kar98K
- Tier 3:
Crossbow and all pistols

#### Preference
Implying how popular a weapon is.

The curve is kind of smooth. Detailed analysis and comparison vs. K/D will follow.

#### Avg_kill_distance
Implying the usage and type of a weapon.

It is easy to divide the weapons into three different ranges:
1. Long-range(> 50m): AWM(the most powerful sniper) ~ VSS(comes with 4x scope, although very powerless)
2. Mid-range(20m~50m): M249(light machine gun) ~ QBZ(I've no idea what it is)
3. Short-range(<20m): UMP9(although compatible with 4x scope) ~ Sawed off

### Two-dimensional:

#### K/D v.s. Preference
First, rank the K/D and preference data of each weapon:

Then, do substraction between them to show the difference:

We may want to say that:
- Tommy Gun, DP-28 and Micro UZI are the most under-estimated(their performances are reasonable but people don't like them)
- Except the pistols that people sometimes have to pick, M24, Kar98K and AWM are the most over-estimated ones

HOWEVER, actually it is unfair to compare long-range snipers vs short-range sub-machine guns in this manner. Therefore, I do the ranking again within the three range groups:

Maybe Tommy and UZI are really good choices?

No remarkable differences in this group, and crossbow...

Maybe we should pick VSS and Mini14, which are decent snipers, instead of widely-known-powerful M24 and Kar98K?
